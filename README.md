## Social-BS

# Inspiration
Many people misuse and believe that what you say and do online doesn't affect anyone but in reality, their "anonymous" presence is still connected to them as a person in the real world.

# What it does
SocialBS lets anyone search through the past 100 tweets of any public Tweet account and determines how potentially offensive the account is while listing all of the potentially offensive tweets detected.

# How we built it
We used Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape Twitter for tweets and Tkinter for the GUI.

# Challenges we ran into
Initially, the GUI was going to be on a website by using JavaScript, but we lacked the knowledge to get it the way we imagined our program. Instead, we solved this by using Tkinter as a GUI which was much easier to implement and the only issue we had was formatting everything properly.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned about a lot of really cool modules that we were not only able to implement in our project, but also learn them within a short period.

# What's next for SocialBS
The next stage of development for SocialBS is to eventually add more social platform support, like Instagram and Facebook by using AI Image detection.
